# three-body-problem
This project is a particle simulation built using OpenFrameworks, a C++ toolkit for creative coding. The simulation models the gravitational interaction between particles (referred to as "bodies") in a 2D space. Users can also interact with the simulation by clicking to add new bodies with unique properties.
